Node JS 
========


Day 1
======

1.Node js is the server side technology  (or)  servre side language.
2.Node js is used to develop the servers  like Http server,  Tcp Server.
3.Node applications are called serverless Applications

4.We can develop node js servers in two ways  
                                           
					   1.Javascript
					   -------------
					   
					               1.scripting language
						       2.It is not supported OOPs.
						       3.javascript is object based.

					   2.Typescript
					   -------------

						       1.it is known as programming language
						       2.It is developed by Microsoft
						       3.It supports the oops.

Node js is  a server side language Or server side scripting language.

Node js is used to develop servers.
                                   
				   Http server
				   Tcp server


We can build node application in two ways 
                                            1.javascript is not object Oriented

					    javascript is the objcet Based scripting language.


					    2.Typescript is the programming language.

					     It is introducted in  the microsoft.

					     It is supports the OOps.


Node js supports the Modules (or)  ( Libraries predefined and User defined libraries).

Modules
-------
1.http         : is used to Build the http servers.

         

2.fs           : fs stands for file system
         
	          fs module used to interact with flat files (texet files, xml files, Json files).


3.Express      : Express Module is used to build the Rest Services . 
      
               
	                           Get 

	                           Post

	                           Delete


4.mongodb       : Mongodb module is used to interact with the mongodb   connecting mongodb without schema   (schema means rules and regulations).

mongoose        : monodb module is connecting with mongodb with schema.

5.mysql         :mysql module is used to interact with the mysql.

6.mssql         :this module used to interact with the sql server.

7.multer        : used to upload and download images from the server.

8.socket.io     : socket.io module used to implement the chat applications.

9.cors          : used to enable the ports communications.

10.body-parser  :used to recieve the data from cleint applications.

11.JWt           : used to implemenet the token based authentication.

12.Oracledb      : it is used to intercat with the oracledb.



Note : Above modules downloads to "node_modules" folder in the current path




we can download this modules from   "npm" (or) "yarn".

"NPM" stands for node package manager.

"NPM" present in NodeJs.

"NPM" will download one by one it is called the synchnorize tool.





"yarn" tool given from the facebook.

"yarn" tool is the asynchronous tool.
